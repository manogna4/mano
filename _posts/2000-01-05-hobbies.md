## Hobbies
I take my Hobbies seriously.\
I nurture them over years, and often chose those that can improve other aspects of my life.\
For example:

+ An interest in custom keyboards led me to improve on existing layouts, which increased the ease with which I code and write, which makes me a better professional.
+ My knowledge of linguistics led me to create a an alternate to the QWERTY keyboard layout that optimized for easy entry of English digrams.
+ Swing dancing has become a part of my fitness routine.

My serious hobbies include:
