## Career: 14 years

I thrive on autonomy.\
I like to nurture long, meaningful relationships with the companies I work with.\
I value impact over status.

### Intrapreneur
+ I am deliberate at decision making and methodical at planning.\
I prioritize projects in my portfolio, and I am usually able to explain the ramifications of changing priorities in real time.
+ I communicate regularly with stakeholders and operators, tailoring the mode and content for the audience.

### Full Stack Data Professional
+ I specialize in quickly finding simple, practical solutions to business problems, showing results, and layering sophistication using that as a base.
+ I do not hide behind data or jargon.\
I believe that the stakeholder's comprehension is crucial to a sustainable solution.
+ I am a generalist.\
I have set up a data warehouse, authored predictive algorithms, created Business Intelligence dashboards for company-wide consumption, and performed ad hoc analyses in real-time decision-making scenarios.

### Product Designer
+ I am attracted to fundamental, human-centered problems and like to approach the solution from first principles.
+ I am eager to acquire entirely new skills in pursuit of an appropriate solution.\
This makes me skilled at adapting techniques from seemingly unrelated fields, and in extending existing techniques beyond their original scope.
