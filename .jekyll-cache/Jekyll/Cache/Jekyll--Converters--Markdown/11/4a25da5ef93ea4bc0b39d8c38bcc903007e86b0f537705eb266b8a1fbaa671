I"r<p><strong>Hey, I am Mano.</strong><br />
My documents insist I should go by ‘Manogna Mano’.</p>

<p>I am an Intrapreneur, a Data Professional and a Product Designer.<br />
A friend suggested I shorten it all to ‘Full Stack Analytics Leader’, so I will.<br />
<strong>I am a Full Stack Analytics Leader.</strong></p>

<p>I invented a financial framework that helps families by tinkering with their lifestyle, instead of overwhelming them with jargon. I call it icedtea.<br />
<strong>I’ll take <a href="https://icedtea.app">icedtea</a> public someday.</strong></p>

<p>I take my hobbies seriously. I nurture them over years, and often chose those that can improve other aspects of my life.<br />
<strong>I am a <a href="#hobbies">Hobbyist</a>.</strong></p>

<p>I grew up in India, Oman and UK.<br />
I’ve taken months off work to travel in Europe and South America.</p>
