I"t<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I take my Hobbies seriously. I nurture them over years and often chose those that can improve other aspects of my life. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An interest in custom keyboards led me to improve on existing layouts, which increased the ease with which I code and write, which makes me a better professional.</li>
  <li>My knowledge of linguistics led me to create a an alternate to the QWERTY keyboard layout that optimized for easy entry of English digrams.</li>
  <li>Swing dancing has become a part of my fitness routine.</li>
</ul>
